# Requirements for the Kivy ADK iOS app
#
# These packages are needed to build and run the application on
# mobile platforms. Versions are pinned where appropriate to
# provide consistency across environments. The package list
# includes Kivy and the Kivy Garden WebView widget for embedding
# web content, the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) which
# provides the web UI and agent infrastructure, the Generative AI
# SDK, and the keyring library for securely storing user
# credentials on the device.
